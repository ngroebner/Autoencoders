# Various autoencoders for seismic analysis

Written in Pytorch.

So far have 2D convolutional autoencoder.

To do:

1. Variational autoencoder.
2. Causal convolutional encoders and decoders for spectrograms (2D) and seismograms (1D)
3. Convolutional temporal encoder/decoder (find reference again).
4. Deep convolutional embedded clustering.
5. Train encoders together, decoders separately based on basin, source, etc to learn generalized encodings of seismic sources.
